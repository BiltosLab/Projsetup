# Projsetup
This is a simple app that i've written aimed at setting up a fundamental file and folder structure for C/C++ projects,
I know better alternatives exist but tbh the development of this app was an enjoyable and an educational experience for me.                                                                                
And it does the job for me so im happy with it (one of the apps that i actually use on my PC)
